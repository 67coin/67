## Community Note

The 67 community was launched and is supported by Maverick Trevillian (“The 67 Kid”)  
alongside his parents Jaime Trevillian and Brandon Trevillian.

The vision is to unite **millions of 67 supporters worldwide**—across all walks of life—around a shared cultural signal.

The Official 67 Coin represents the tokenized participation layer of this broader movement for those who choose to engage on-chain.

We believe this cultural reach creates unprecedented retail onboarding potential.

Our objective is to continue expanding global access to $67 by pursuing Tier-1 exchange listings, supported by:

- Fixed supply
- Fair launch mechanics
- No presale
