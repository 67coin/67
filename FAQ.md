## 🔹 What is The Official 67 Coin ($67)?

The Official 67 Coin ($67) is a community-driven cultural participation token deployed on the Solana blockchain.

It is inspired by the global “67” meme phenomenon and exists to represent culture-first participation, not traditional financial utility, equity, or ownership.

---

## 🔹 Who created The Official 67 Coin ($67)?

The original “67” meme and cultural signal was created by Maverick Trevillian (“The 67 Kid”).

The token was launched as a fair-launch Solana SPL token with the help of Maverick and a small group of college-aged friends, allowing the community to participate on-chain from day one.

As the movement expanded, Maverick’s parents — Jaime Trevillian and Brandon Trevillian — assumed long-term stewardship of the project. Their role is to:

- Coordinate official communications  
- Protect the community from scams, impersonation, and misinformation  
- Maintain clarity around official channels and resources  

They are supported by community contributors with experience in operations, moderation, design, and exchange onboarding.  
Strategic direction remains community-driven.

---

## 🔹 Is “The 67 Kid” officially involved?

Yes.

Maverick Trevillian (“The 67 Kid”) is the original creator of the 67 meme and was involved in the token’s launch.

Public-facing stewardship is supported by his parents alongside a broader contributor community.  
Like other decentralized memecoin ecosystems, momentum comes from the community — not a centralized entity.

## 🔹 What does “67” actually mean?

“**67**” (also written 6-7, “six seven”) is a viral internet meme and cultural signal that gained traction in early 2025, particularly among Gen Z and Gen Alpha.

According to *Know Your Meme*, the trend traces back to the song  
“Doot Doot” — Skrilla ft. G Herbo (Dec 2024).

In January 2025:
- “6-7” became a bait-and-switch phrase in TikTok & Instagram Reels  
- Often used in LaMelo Ball highlight edits (he is 6'7")  

The meme evolved into:
- Forced “six seven” call-outs on camera  
- A recognizable hand gesture (see-saw motion, palms up)  
- Spoken phrases like *“six, seven”*  

Mainstream acceleration occurred after a viral Cam Wilder basketball video where a kid yelled “Ay, 6-7.”  
That kid was later identified as Maverick Trevillian, cementing “67” as a cultural reference.

## 🔹 What makes 67 Coin different from other memecoins?
