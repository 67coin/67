## About

The Official 67 Coin ($67) is the on-chain representation of a global cultural phenomenon.

67 started as a gesture, a meme, and a signal — spreading organically across schools, gaming communities, sports, and social media worldwide.

The culture came first.  
The movement came first.  
The token came last.

$67 is not a project trying to manufacture culture.  
It is a token that allows people to participate on-chain in something that already exists everywhere.
